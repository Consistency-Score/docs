# What is ConsistencyScore.com? 

Some skills need to be honed consistently in order for you to actually progress in them, or to become world class in them. 
This is an open source project that allows people to once a day/week, input a consistency score as to how well they did. 

This is a way for you to publically or privately track your own consistency, with as much or as little consequences as you 
would like.

Say you want to learn a new language or you want to learn piano, or say you want to become a world-class runner.
These things are only going to happen through consistent doing. 

It's become a meme that you need to put in 10,000 hours of DOING in order 
to become an expert - most of us have put in 10,000 hours of wishing.
