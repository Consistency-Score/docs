# Set Your Own Level of Consequence for Failure

With this open-source tool, you can define your own goals and your own time period you want to track yourself on, 
and ALSO your level of consequence, should you fail to meet your consistency goals. 

Something worth mentioning here is that consistencyscore.com is all about consistency, and not absolute performance. 
The actual performance and goals on absolute terms are left up to you, all we care about here is CONSISTENCY, and whether 
you are improving and getting more consistent. 

### The Lowest Consequences 
you are totally anonymous, the only person who will look at your consistency graph and be disgusted is you. 

### The Highest Level of Consequence
I guess this would be if you have a following on social media and you posted about your goals and gave people a link 
to your consistencyscore.com profile.
