# How to Contribute

* if you are unsure about the steps below and how to contribute to an open-source projecton GitHub, then contact me on chris@consistencyscore.com, send me your contribution and 
I will merge it in for you and make sure it gets properly attributed to you. 

1. write a blogpost on something adjacent to this idea
2. add your name and deets to the `authors.yml` file under blog folder if you've written a blogpost and the `authors.yml` file under tutorials if you've written a tutorial
3. make a PR and I will review and merge. 

Thanks in advance for contributing. Consistency is really the secret sauce to most people who consistently outperform! 

Chris.
